# To do yourself

- Skim Hadley Wickham's introduction to Git: https://r-pkgs.org/git.html
- Go over general Github terms and practices here: https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

# To submit on blackboard, due 10-27-2020, 5:00pm

- Install Git, and create a Github account. 
    - Create a repository. Clone your repository to an R project. Add files to your project. Then upload the files in that project to your Github account, such as a previous homework assignment. 
    - Fork this repository (https://github.com/mdozmorov/R_notes) to your account, so that you will have references for this course.
    - Update your Github profile to include some relevant information about yourself, such as your program and/or interests.
    - What do the words 'minimal' and 'complete' mean in the context of Git commits? 
    

Document your responses to these questions appropriately.
