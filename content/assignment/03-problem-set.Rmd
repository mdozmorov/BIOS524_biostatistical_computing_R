- Install package "babynames"

  - How many values are in the `babynames` object?

  - What their data types?
    
  - Get an overview of `babynames`

  - Plot the proportion of your name usage vs. year. Choose closest or random name, if your exact spelling is not available

- Load in the ToothGrowth dataset, which comes with R. 
  - Produce a boxplot of the tooth length variable, with x- and y-axis labels as well as a title. 
  
  - Change the graphics parameters to a window of one row and two columns of plots. Then, populate the first one with a scatterplot of dose on the x-axis and length on the y-axis, only using observations with a VC supplement type. Populate the second one with a scatterplot of dose on the x-axis and length on the y-axis, only using observations with an OJ supplement type. Provide informative axis labels. Use filled-in circles as the plotting character in the first plot, and filled-in triangles as the plotting character in the second plot.
  
  - Fit a linear regression model of tooth length on the variables 'supp' and 'dose'. Change the graphics parameters back to just one plot, not several. Plot *only* the QQ-plot of residuals from this regression model, filled in with blue circles. 

- Set a seed to ensure reproducibility. Then, generate $n=100$ random variables from a a $Exponential(\lambda=5)$ distribution. Plot the empirical CDF (cumulative distribution function) of this data with informative axes labels. Make a really long title - so long that you must use a special character to get the title to go on two lines.
