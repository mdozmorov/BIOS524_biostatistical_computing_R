<p>First, create an R Markdown document in which you will complete this assignment. Demonstrate your knowledge of R Markdown in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Produce a section header that says “R Markdown” and is bigger than normal text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Within this section, produce a subsection header that is smaller than the section header and says “R Markdown features”.</li>
<li>Write a sentence that includes bold text, italicized text, and normal text. (This will not be in a code chunk.)</li>
<li>Write a sentence that includes one inline R code in the sentence.</li>
<li>Link an image from your computer - that is school-appropriate - to be output when the document is knitted together.</li>
<li>Produce a 3x3 table with column headers just using text - no code chunk. (See Lecture 4 for a hint).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Produce a section header that says “Statistical functions” and is bigger than normal text.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read in the dataset ‘warpbreaks’. It comes as a default with R.
<ul>
<li>Fit a regression model of the number of breaks on the type of wool, the level of tension, and the interaction between wool and tension.</li>
<li>Look at the summary. Interpret the results.</li>
<li>Plot only the QQ-plot of this model. Then, provide code that would save it as a pdf to your computer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now, read in the ‘UCBAdmissions’ dataset, which comes as default with R.
<ul>
<li>Only keep the admissions data from Department A.</li>
<li>Run a chi-squared test of independence between gender and admittance. Comment on the results.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Going to simulate some data now. Set a seed for reproducibility.
<ul>
<li>Generate <span class="math inline">\(1000\)</span> observations from a Normal distribution with parameters <span class="math inline">\(\mu=5, \sigma=2\)</span>.</li>
<li>Plot the empirical cdf of these data. Add a horizontal line in red at the <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span> mark on the y-axis.</li>
<li>Use R’s statistical distribution functions to determine the <span class="math inline">\(80^{th}\)</span> percentile of the above normal distribution, and store it in a variable called q80.
<ul>
<li>Add a point to the plot that has x-coordinate equal to the <span class="math inline">\(80^{th}\)</span> percentile of your sample data and y-coordinate equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span>. Fill it in with some color.</li>
<li>Add another point that has x-coordinate equal to q80 and y-coordinate equal to <span class="math inline">\(0.8\)</span>. Fill it in with another color.</li>
<li>Think about what all this means.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
