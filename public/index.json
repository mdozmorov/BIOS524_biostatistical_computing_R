Write a sentence that includes bold text, italicized text, and normal text. (This will not be in a code chunk.) Write a sentence that includes one inline R code in the sentence. Link an image from your computer - that is school-appropriate - to be output when the document is knitted together. Produce a 3x3 table with column headers just using text - no code chunk. (See Lecture 4 for a hint).  Produce a section header that says “Statistical functions” and is bigger than normal text.\n Read in the dataset ‘warpbreaks’. It comes as a default with R.  Fit a regression model of the number of breaks on the type of wool, the level of tension, and the interaction between wool and tension. Look at the summary. Interpret the results. Plot only the QQ-plot of this model. Then, provide code that would save it as a pdf to your computer.  Now, read in the ‘UCBAdmissions’ dataset, which comes as default with R.  Only keep the admissions data from Department A. Run a chi-squared test of independence between gender and admittance. Comment on the results.  Going to simulate some data now.

Generate a random sample of size \\(50\\) from a standard normal distribution and compute the usual \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval using the t-distribution. Write your own function to generate a random sample of size \\(n\\) from a normal distribution with mean equal to \\(\\mu\\) and standard deviation equal to \\(\\sigma\\) and compute the usual \\(100(1−\\alpha)\\%\\) t confidence interval. Compare your results to that from t.test.\n Question Two: Making a Package: Pythagorean Theorem and Trimmed Mean Create an R package that includes functions to perform the following tasks.\n The Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two side: \\(c^2=a^2+b^2\\). Write a function that, given the lengths of two sides of the triangle, calculates the length of the third side.  Note: This function should be flexible - that is, the function works if I give it values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), or \\(b\\) and \\(c\\), or \\(a\\) and \\(c\\). If the user only provides the length of one side, the function should throw an error. Likewise, if the user provides the lengths of all three sides, the function should throw an error. If the user provides any values other than numeric values, the function should throw an error.\n Write your own trimmed mean function that calculates the mean of a numeric vector \\(x\\), ignoring the \\(s\\) smallest and \\(l\\) largest values (this is a trimmed mean). For example, if \\(x=c(1,7,3,2,5,0.5,9,10)\\), \\(s=1\\), and \\(l=2\\), your function would return the mean of \\(c(1,7,3,2,5)\\) (this is \\(x\\) with the \\(1\\) smallest value and the \\(2\\) largest values removed). Note: Your function should check if \\(x\\) has at least \\(s+l+1\\) values. If not, return some error message with stop().  Document your functions in the package using Roxygen2 syntax.

This course is an introduction to R programming. It covers R fundamentals and statistical functions, R packages, data management/manipulation and plotting using Tidyverse, reproducible research with GitHub, interactive apps with Shiny. No knowledge of calculus/algebra is required although some statistical operations will be discussed.\n Topics  R/RStudio Vector/matrix operations Probability distributions and random number generation Statistical functions RMarkdown, GitHub Functions, Packages Data management, tidyverse R graphics, data visualization Interactive web apps with Shiny   Prerequisites  No formal course requirements, but basic knowledge of the following will help  Basic linear algebra: vectors, matrices, determinants Simple calculus: derivatives, integrals, gradients Some probability theory: probability, random variables, distributions Basic statistics knowledge: descriptive statistics, estimators. (Linear) modeling  Hardware  A laptop, Mac or Linux OSs are recommended.    Learning Objectives Learn advanced R programming and reproducible research practices\n Understand principles and tools for R data analysis and visualization\n Implement basic types of neural networks using Keras/TensorFlow R interface   About the class This course is a part of 3-credit hour course. The class will be conducted via Zoom and include lecture and coding parts. Classes will not be recorded. Course material will be publicly available. The syllabus is subject to change.\n Course Website: https://bios524-biostatistical-computing-R.netlify.com\n Office Hours: contact the Instructor with questions and on-demand Zoom meeting requests\n   Attendance Attendance is not checked, but students are responsible for all announcements made in class.\nHomework Homework will consist of problem sets for material covered. Files should be named, e.g., LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-HW01.Rmd. Homework due date is one week after the lecture. Late homework will NOT be accepted unless permission was given by the instructor. Assignments that are not well organized/documented will receive no credit. Working in small groups is allowed. However, you must do the final writing-up of solutions entirely by yourself. Any two assignments which are word-for-word exactly the same or highly similar in coding style will both receive zero credit. There will be no extra credit projects available.\n Final project  A take-home final project\n Final project should be submitted as a fully reproducible GitHub repository The due date to be determined. Final project page   Grading Policy  Each homework is graded on the scale 0-10, 10 points being the best Total homework grade possible - 100 points  Missed deadline - minus 3 points Missed deadline and not submitted later - minus 6 points  Final Project is graded on the scale 0-100, 100 points being the best  Homework and final project grades will be averaged.\nStandard A-F grading system will be applied:\n A: 90-100 B: 80-89 C: 70-79 D: 60-69 F: 0-59    Copyright Every reasonable effort has been made to protect the copyright requirements of materials used in this course by referring to the original sources.\n Diversity and inclusivity A primary goal of this course is to be inclusive and of value to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. All participants in this course are encouraged to help to provide a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.\n Policies and resources  Students should visit http://go.vcu.edu/syllabus and review all syllabus statement information.
