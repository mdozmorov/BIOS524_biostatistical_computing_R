Demonstrate your knowledge of R Markdown in the following ways:\n Produce a section header that says “R Markdown” and is bigger than normal text.\n Within this section, produce a subsection header that is smaller than the section header and says “R Markdown features”. Write a sentence that includes bold text, italicized text, and normal text. (This will not be in a code chunk.) Write a sentence that includes one inline R code in the sentence. Link an image from your computer - that is school-appropriate - to be output when the document is knitted together. Produce a 3x3 table with column headers just using text - no code chunk. (See Lecture 4 for a hint).  Produce a section header that says “Statistical functions” and is bigger than normal text.\n Read in the dataset ‘warpbreaks’. It comes as a default with R.  Fit a regression model of the number of breaks on the type of wool, the level of tension, and the interaction between wool and tension. Look at the summary. Interpret the results. Plot only the QQ-plot of this model. Then, provide code that would save it as a pdf to your computer.  Now, read in the ‘UCBAdmissions’ dataset, which comes as default with R.  Only keep the admissions data from Department A. Run a chi-squared test of independence between gender and admittance. Comment on the results.  Going to simulate some data now. Set a seed for reproducibility.  Generate \\(1000\\) observations from a Normal distribution with parameters \\(\\mu=5, \\sigma=2\\). Plot the empirical cdf of these data. Add a horizontal line in red at the \\(0.8\\) mark on the y-axis. Use R’s statistical distribution functions to determine the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile of the above normal distribution, and store it in a variable called q80.  Add a point to the plot that has x-coordinate equal to the \\(80^{th}\\) percentile of your sample data and y-coordinate equal to \\(0.8\\). Fill it in with some color. Add another point that has x-coordinate equal to q80 and y-coordinate equal to \\(0.8\\). Fill it in with another color. Think about what all this means.

Then, populate the first one with a scatterplot of dose on the x-axis and length on the y-axis, only using observations with a VC supplement type. Populate the second one with a scatterplot of dose on the x-axis and length on the y-axis, only using observations with an OJ supplement type. Provide informative axis labels.

Change the graphics parameters back to just one plot, not several. Plot only the QQ-plot of residuals from this regression model, filled in with blue circles.  Set a seed to ensure reproducibility. Then, generate n=100 random variables from an Exponential distribution with lambda=5 parameter. Plot the empirical CDF (cumulative distribution function) of this data with informative axes labels.

This course is designed to provide an introduction to R programming. We will cover the data management/manipulation, common graphical and statistical procedures both in R. No knowledge of calculus/algebra is required although some vector/matrix operations will be discussed.\n Topics  R/RStudio Vector/matrix operations Probability distributions and random number generation Statistical functions RMarkdown, GitHub Functions, Packages Data management, tidyverse R graphics, data visualization Interactive web apps with Shiny   Prerequisites  No formal course requirements, but basic knowledge of the following will help  Basic linear algebra: vectors, matrices, determinants Simple calculus: derivatives, integrals, gradients Some probability theory: probability, random variables, distributions Basic statistics knowledge: descriptive statistics, estimators. (Linear) modeling  Hardware  A laptop, Mac or Linux OSs are recommended.    Learning Objectives Learn advanced R programming and reproducible research practices\n Understand principles and tools for R data analysis and visualization\n Implement basic types of neural networks using Keras/TensorFlow R interface   About the class This course is a part of 3-credit hour course. The class will be conducted via Zoom and include lecture and coding parts. Classes will not be recorded. Course material will be publicly available. The syllabus is subject to change.\n Course Website: https://bios524-biostatistical-computing-R.netlify.com\n Office Hours: contact the Instructor with questions and on-demand Zoom meeting requests\n   Attendance Attendance is not checked, but students are responsible for all announcements made in class.\nHomework Homework will consist of problem sets for material covered. Files should be named, e.g., LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME-HW01.Rmd. Homework due date is one week after the lecture. Late homework will NOT be accepted unless permission was given by the instructor. Assignments that are not well organized/documented will receive no credit. Working in small groups is allowed. However, you must do the final writing-up of solutions entirely by yourself. Any two assignments which are word-for-word exactly the same or highly similar in coding style will both receive zero credit. There will be no extra credit projects available.\n Final project  A take-home final project\n Final project should be submitted as a fully reproducible GitHub repository The due date to be determined. Final project page   Grading Policy  Homework: 60% of grade Final Project: 40% of grade  This course will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis. Pass is defined as a grade of at least 70%\n  Copyright Every reasonable effort has been made to protect the copyright requirements of materials used in this course by referring to the original sources.\n Diversity and inclusivity A primary goal of this course is to be inclusive and of value to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. All participants in this course are encouraged to help to provide a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability.\n Policies and resources  Students should visit http://go.vcu.edu/syllabus and review all syllabus statement information.
